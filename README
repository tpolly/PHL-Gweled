This repository contains software that was used in the study "Reevaluating Passive Haptic Learning of Morse Code" (https://doi.org/10.1145/3341163.3347714). In particular, this is a patched version of the game Gweled. The game was adapted to run indefinitely (restart if no moves left) and to output the score on stdout.
